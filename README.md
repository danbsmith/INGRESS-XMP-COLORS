This repository contains design files for a toy modeled after the shape of an XMP from the game Ingress.  In addition to the shape, it contains circuitry which will adjust the color of RGB LEDs using a potentiometer to match the colors associated with the levels of Ingress players.

The plastic base is designed in FreeCAD.

The circuit board is designed in KiCAD.
